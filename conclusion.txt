It's always us, who ruin the responsiveness:
    - Don't use height
    - Use percentage, rem, em
    - if we set width, we should also set max/min width

    -use rem for margins, because it is consistent (root base 16px)
    -use em for padding, because its base will be the font-size defined for that
        class. Thath means a button for example will be consistently rescaled just by
        givin it a new font-size
    -em uses parents properties, and it is cumulative! All separate em settings summed up as we
        dive deeper from one parent to a child
    -avoid using em for setting font size
    -in some casese it might be a good idea to set font size in vmax/vmin or vh/vw
